# tapl-coq

My Coq proofs for the TAPL book.
Work in progress, come back in a few years.

Some quick notes for the future me:

To generate `CoqMakefile` I've used:

```sh
$ coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o CoqMakefile
```

See [the docs](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/utilities.html#building-a-coq-project-with-coq-makefile).

## Notes

I recommend using [pLam](https://github.com/slovnicki/pLam) to play around with pure Î»-calculus.
